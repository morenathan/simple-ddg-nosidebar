# Helping My Web Be Calmer
<p>These are just some user CSS files that make my life easier. I have autism and part of it is being easily distractted. When I find a page with something that will improve it for me I use the browser tools and Stylus to remove it.</p>
<p>Those little tidbits becomes a "simple" css addition. They get submitted for others if they find them useful.</p>
